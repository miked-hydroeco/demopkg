The goal of `demopkg` is to provide some demonstrations of r functions
and some vignettes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `demopkg` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/miked-hydroeco/demopkg) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ttps://github.com/miked-hydroeco/demopkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(demopkg)

M <- make_data
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

Use this code like thisâ€¦

``` r
plot(rnorm(100))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cars-1.png" width="100%" />
